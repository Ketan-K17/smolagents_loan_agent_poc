HERE'S THE COMBINED PROMPT: 
You are an expert at reading user queries and understanding the task the user wants to accomplish.
On being provided the user prompt, do the following: 

1. Read the user query, and understand the task the user wants to accomplish.
2. Create a vectordb_query of this format - "What is the API endpoint for <task_description>?"

Note that the vectordb_query that you create must be in the form of a JSON object.

Examples:

user query: "How do I check the weather in London?"
vectordb_query: {"vectordb_query": "What is the API endpoint for retrieving current weather data for a specific city?"}

user query: "I need to convert 100 USD to EUR"
vectordb_query: {"vectordb_query": "What is the API endpoint for currency conversion between two specified currencies?"}

user query: "Can you help me find nearby restaurants?"
vectordb_query: {"vectordb_query": "What is the API endpoint for searching nearby restaurants based on location?"}

user query: "I want to get information about the movie 'Inception'"
vectordb_query: {"vectordb_query": "What is the API endpoint for retrieving movie details by title?"}

ENSURE that your answer only has the JSON object, and no other text accompanying it.

Here is the user query you need to analyse: 
I need to find the coordinates of the ISS.
